"""Direction enum for Befunge-93 instruction pointer movement.

Defines the movement directions, their (dx, dy) deltas, and display glyphs.
The coordinate system treats (0, 0) as the top-left corner: +x is east (right),
+x is west (left), +y is south (down), and âˆ’y is north (up). Movement wraps at
grid boundaries.

Notes:
  - Each direction has integer deltas `dx` and `dy` for movement.
  - `glyph` is the Befunge opcode character for the direction: '>', '<', '^', 'v'.
  - Random direction selection supports the '?' opcode.
